# The Butterfly Interest List
Samantha Kukuk (skukuk1)

## Proposal project description
I'm interested in making some type of site that combines multiple database sites into one. As of right now, I'm thinking of having my database receive, read, and store things like titles of the anime and manga, authors and directors, genre, ratings, and more. Both from user input and from the different sites. I plan to potentially make a site where you would be able to input your anime and manga with extra details, and they would be stored in a list for you to view. I may also include the option to add pictures to these lists. I want to create a place where games, movies, and anime can all combine instead of being separated. In the future, I might add different things for movies, shows, books, figures, and games.
