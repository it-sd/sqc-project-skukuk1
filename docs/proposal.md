The Butterfly Interest List
=============
I'm interested in making some type of site that combines multiple database sites into one. As of right now, I'm thinking of having my database receive, read, store, and cache that data locally. Examples would be titles of the anime and manga, authors and directors, genre, ratings, and more. Both from user input and from the different sites. I plan to potentially make a site where you would be able to input your anime and manga with extra details, and they would be stored in a list for you to view. I may also include the option to add pictures to these lists. I want to create a place where games, movies, and anime can all combine instead of being separated. In the future, I might add different things for movies, shows, books, figures, and games.

Database use
-------------
As I stated, I'm interested in making a place where anime, manga, and a whole bunch of other things can all come together that will be cached locally. I also noted earlier that I would have my database potentially receive, read, and store titles, authors/developers, genres, and maybe some other small things. For anime, I would have the title, author and/or director, genre, description, and different ratings. For manga, I would have the title, author and/or director, genre, description, For anime, I would have the title, author and/or director, genre, description, and different ratings. As for games, I think I would add a title, developer, genre, description, and personal rating. Finally, for movies, I think I would add a title, director, genre, and personal rating. I might add pictures as well as other, smaller things to each. As you can see, they are mostly similar like having titles, genre, and other things but have tiny differences.
