The Butterfly Interest List Design
=============
This page will include the original and new designs I implemented, along with pictures and explanations.

Original Designs
-------------
The overall design of the site was a little funky at first. There was no logo at the top of the site; a footer was missing; and there were spelling errors throughout. For example, the original about page had some spelling and grammar errors. One of the spelling errors that kept reoccurring was the name of the project being wrong, which happened on the original about page. Another thing that was messy regarding the design was having a link to the health page that had nothing to do with the project. Overall, my site lacked both aesthetics and consistency. See the images below for reference.

On the home page, the users can note the different lists that are populated locally with data. Which currently include the anime list and the manga list. When a user first looks at the lists, they might notice how messy they really are. Overall, everything is randomly styled in each list. For example, the data is centered when it should be in the top left corner. See the image below for reference.

But the real issues start to appear when the user adds more data to the different lists. When the lists were first implemented, I expected the data to be vertical, with every new entry added to the different lists. But everything is formatted horizontally instead, which makes the entries really hard to read. See the images below for reference.

New Designs
-------------
The new design for the site features a logo at the top of every page and a footer at the bottom of every page. I also updated the titles for each page to make it easier to understand which page you're on. One of the last things I changed in the overall design was removing the unnecessary link to the health page. Overall, the site is more visually appealing and cohesive. See the image below for reference.

On the home page, I fixed the errors and styled the different lists as lists instead of tables. The styling is starting to look a lot better and more aesthetically pleasing. I feel like the entries are a lot easier to read, and there is more control over what is added as well as how it's styled. Instead of being added horizontally before, each entry now has its own spot. See the images below for reference.
